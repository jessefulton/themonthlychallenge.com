    <p>In <a href="challenges/friendly-february/2009/02.html">February</a>, I had to talk to a stranger each day. Today, I had to talk to 3.</p>
<p>Person number 1 was a cyclist who was riding right behind me on my way into work this morning. First I almost spit on him, then he popped his tire so I turned around and tried to help him out. Nothing terribly exciting, but he was a stranger and we talked.</p>
<p>Person number 2 was the facilities guy at work. When I got ready to ride into work this morning, I thought I was being cool by only bringing my house key instead of my whole keychain. I&nbsp;had forgotten that I&nbsp;had a locked drawer at work which I needed to get into, and the key for that drawer was on the keychain back in my apartment. People made fun of me. Then  I&nbsp;had to talk to the facilities guy to help me try to break into the locked drawer. He did not make fun of me. Thanks, facilities guy.</p>
<p>Person number 3 was any number of people at the bars JBlake dragged me out to later that night. Believe it or not, nobody terribly interesting goes to Hollywood bars.</p>

But if the internet says they're manly things, then I guess I have to do them. I'm still in the middle of doing both and I've realized that: 1. I have too much junk laying around, and 2. I spend <em><strong>way</strong></em> too much money dining out.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>

<p>Last Friday, I enjoyed a half-day at work and took my lady on a date in the afternoon. We had planned to go picnicking in Griffith Park and then head over to the Autry Center after. But we ended up just relaxing in Griffith Park the whole time, drinking some wine and watching the Merry-Go-Round. It was a great way to spend the afternoon.</p>
<h3><a title=" Memorize &amp;ldquo;If&amp;rdquo;&quot;" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/09/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-10-memorize-if/">Day 10: Memorize &ldquo;If&rdquo;</a></h3>
<p>I have a terrible memory and really should do this. But I haven't yet. I also procrastinate too much.</p>
<h3><a title=" Give Yourself a Testicular Exam&quot;" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/10/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-11-give-yourself-a-testicular-exam/">Day 11: Give Yourself a Testicular Exam</a></h3>

<p>A long time ago, I joined a site called <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/jesswa">43&nbsp;Things</a>. I've updated my list on there and on their sister site, <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/jesswa">43 Places</a>. It may not be the ultimate list, but it's a good start to the Bucket list. I'm sure there are tons of things I just haven't thought of...</p>
<p>Also, the second part of today's challenge was to get started on one of your bucket list items. Well, I've always wanted to <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/36364/hit-all-the-buttons-in-a-crowded-elevator">push all of the buttons in a crowded elevato</a>r. So, the next time I'm in a crowded elevator, it's go time.</p>

<p>I will do this before the end of the weekend.</p>

    <p>the fearless <a href="users/jesse.html">leader</a> of&nbsp;The Monthly Challenge&nbsp;told me that i should take before and after pictures of things i'm doing in my room. i only have one of these to share, but it's pretty super! look at all those things lined up on shelves. look at 'em.</p>

<p>i also framed several things this evening, so i'll be taking pictures of those once they go up. a certain <a target="aaron brothers" href="http://www.aaronbrothers.com/">frame store</a> is having a pretty awesome sale. i recommend going and spending money you don't have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>our house warming party is this weekend, so i have to kick this challenge into high gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year, after taking a typography course, I totally redid <a href="http://jessefulton.com/media/resume-September2008.pdf">my resume.</a> I was really pleased with the way it turned out and had no need to redo it (although the colors do need to be tweaked for printing.) So instead of revamping the whole thing, I just <a href="http://jessefulton.com/media/resume-2009-07.pdf">updated it</a> a little bit to include what I've done in the past year or so.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;looked up one of my best friends from high school/junior high and &quot;sent him a facebook.&quot; It's weird how close we used to be, and then out of nowhere just stopped talking. I&nbsp;don't think I've spoken to him in at least 8 years. It's really crazy...</p>

<p>I guess a blog is kind of like a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243655/">gournal</a>. But today's task sounds kind of like <a href="challenges/notebooking-november/2008/11.html">Notebooking November</a>. I guess I'm going to have to start that up again. Scans to follow...</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
Here&rsquo;s your 30 Days to a Better Man-Day 3 task in a nutshell:
<ul>
<li>Pick an area in your where you think a mentor can help you and draw up a list of three potential mentors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Describe why you think they&rsquo;d be good.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By the end of the 24 hours, contact this mentor. Send an email or letter, call them, or drop by their office. You don&rsquo;t actually have to visit with them during this day, but make contact with them in some form.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a mentor when you're at Disneyland all day. I went camping immediately after and the same thing applies... I did come up with a few names though, and I'll try to ask one of them before the month is over.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/03/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-4-increase-your-testosterone/">Day 4: Increase Your Testosterone</a></h3>
<p>The challenge for day 4 was to do at least three things which increase the amount of testosterone your body produces. The easy part was that I almost always do at least three of those things every day, but today I made sure to do more. Seven out of nine ain't bad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get at least 8 hours of sleep tonight.</li>
<li>Do not smoke at all today.</li>
<li>Do no eat anything with soy in it.</li>
<li>Meditate for at least 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Do resistance training.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of good fat.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of animal protein.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of cruciferous vegetables.</li>
<li>Have morning sex (if you partner is willing, of course).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/04/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-5-cultivate-your-gratitude/">Day 5: Cultivate Your Gratitude</a></h3>
<p>Day five's task is a two-parter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
Part 1: Cultivate Your Personal Gratitude
<p>It's time to take stock of all the good things in life that we have to be thankful for. <strong>So task #1 is to make a list of 10 things that you're grateful for.</strong></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Show Your Gratitude to Others</strong></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><strong>So task #2 is to give 3 thank you&rsquo;s to 3 different people today.</strong> These have to be specific thank yous. I&rsquo;m not talking about the waiter bringing your soup and you saying, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; in return, although you could at the end of the meal say, &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for the extraordinary service you gave tonight.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay to thank people just for doing their job well. Yeah, they&rsquo;re just doing their job, but I think we all know plenty of people who can&rsquo;t even rise to that level, and I&rsquo;m personally grateful when people have enough integrity to do so.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So here is my list (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>My health, or what I have left of it.</li>
<li>Living in a first-world country with easy access to food, shelter, and running, potable water. However, I have heard that this Obama character is a socialist...</li>
<li>Having an unconditionally loving family. I could probably murder someone, and they'd still love me. I'm not saying I would, but that's just how awesome they are.</li>
<li>The sounds and smells of being in the middle of nowhere.</li>
<li>Being able to walk to pretty much anything I'd need. Especially considering I live in LA.</li>
<li>Electricity - <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6eff3fba0d/drunk-history-vol-2-featuring-jack-black-from-drunk-history-jack-black-derekwaters-and-jeremykonner">thanks, Ben Franklin</a>.</li>
<li>The internet. Just like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">printing press</a> before it, the widespread adoption of the internet combined with distributed computing, natural language processing, etc. is going to create an information revolution (assuming that the revolution hasn't already begun.)&nbsp;That, and I'm just a big nerd...</li>
<li>The internal combustion engine. Without it, travel of all distances would be so much more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Michael Bloomberg. Sounds like a really random thing to be grateful for, until you find out that he pretty much paid for my whole college education. I always say I hated college, and I&nbsp;did, but I'm still grateful for the chance to learn as much as I did, despite being miserable for the majority of it.</li>
<li>Not working, AKA vacation and/or weekends. Don't get me wrong, I like my job (most of the time), but after spending a long week in the office, there is nothing better than spending a long weekend relaxing. A few months ago, I had <a href="challenges/mandex-may/2009/05/i-wanna-stay-bed-all-day-its-mandex-may.html">one of the most relaxing days</a> I'd had in a very long time and it was incredible. I love the lazy days where the only thing to do is enjoy the present.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second part of the challenge, I'm in the middle of writing letters to three people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill - my Mom's boyfriend of God knows how many years and probably one of the most generous and sefless people I've ever met. (If you're reading this and you know him, please don't tell him.)</li>
<li>Coach Powers - My high school track coach. Few people have ever made me work as hard as him and without his help (and the help of my track team) I never would have imagined how far I could push myself, and how much pleasure can come as a result of so much pain.</li>
<li>Dr. Kraft - A professor I had in college who really changed the way I view people. I thought I was open-minded before I met him, but I really had no idea what that meant. I still have a lot of room to grow, but I'd credit him for really challenging my perspective and allowing me to become a more accepting person.</li>
</ul>

    <p>yesterday i went to Target and wound up with three amazing things to tell you. only the third one directly applies to the challenge though.</p>
<p>#1 omg, i saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Eklund">Greg Eklund</a>. you know, he was the drummer for Everclear?&nbsp;and now is in the delightful band <a href="http://www.theoohlas.com/">The Oohlas</a>?&nbsp;at least, i think it was him. he was hanging out in the baby aisles. adorable.</p>
<p>#2 The Wiz is one of the best movies ever. and by &quot;best&quot;&nbsp;i mean &quot;fucking crazy.&quot; don't worry, i won't think you're a &quot;two-bit carnie hustler&quot;&nbsp;if you don't like it. found it, bought it, came with eight of the songs off the soundtrack, watched it that afternoon. diana ross?&nbsp;michael jackson? c'mon, ease on down, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ztDwyEuiBY">ease on down the road</a>.</p>
<p>#3 <a href="https://www.huggablehangers.com/index.asp">Huggable-motherfucking-Hangers</a>. my target accomplice really wants me to have an organized closet, i think partly due to her line of work in costume. she told me i need to get these hangers because they'll revolutionize my closet space. i thought she was being dramatic. she wasn't. they hangers have changed my life and i want more. like, 100 of them. not exaggerating. 100 more hangers. these are certainly going to help with keep my closet a sane place. usually i feel like i have to choose which clothes to hang and which to fold, but it's looking like i am going to be hanging everything i own just so i can be with these hangers.</p>

    <p>For day two, I'm supposed to <a title=" Shine Your Shoes&quot;" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/01/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-2-shine-your-shoes/">shine my shoes</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So your task today is to shine your shoes. Get out every pair of dress shoes that you own and get them all into ship shape condition. You never know when you&rsquo;re going to need to don a pair, and the last thing you want to do is be ready to run at the door to an important meeting and realize that your shoes are in no condition to meet the public. Having a closet full of shined shoes ensures that you are ready for any occasion, at the drop of a hat. Plus, shining your shoes is the kind of quiet, repetitive activity that will calm your mind and soothe your stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belive it or not, I don't own any shoe polish. I&nbsp;was going to pick some up after work today, but I realized that the only pair of leather dress shoes that I&nbsp;own (and occasionally wear) is a weird deep brown color. Now I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;did shine my shoes once or twice as a kid (they were probably Air Jordan's) and as I recall, the shoe polish needs to match the shoe. Well, I didn't have the shoes with me, so I never bought any polish. So, before I head out for the night, I've given all of my shoes a nice once over with a wet rag, and I must say that it did get rid of <em>most</em> of the dust.</p>

      <h2><a href="challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07/core-values.html" title="Core Values">Core Values</a></h2>
  
      <span class="submitted">Wed, 07/01/2009 - 23:24 | by <strong><a href="users/jesse.html" title="View user profile.">Jesse</a></strong></span>

    <p>Today is <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/31/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/">day one</a> of my <a href="http://www.themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07">31 Days to Becoming a Better Man</a>. And by &quot;my 31 days,&quot; I mean &quot;<a href="http://artofmanliness.com">TAoM</a>'s 30 days + 1 Jesse bonus day.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your task for Day 1 of our 30 Days to a Better Man Project is to discover, clearly define, and write down your core values.</strong> Before we begin, let&rsquo;s be clear that we&rsquo;re not trying to define goals here. Goals are specific actions, like &ldquo;becoming financially independent by age 30&Prime; or &ldquo;asking my girlfriend to marry me this June.&rdquo; What we are looking for are values: the ideas that you esteem to be of great worth and that give structure to your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I've been thinking about these for a while (well, the better part of a day) and here's what I've come up with. It was really tough cutting it down to five core values, but I'm happy with the results:</p>
<h3>Selflessness</h3>
<p>A true man is completely selfless. At the end of Terminator 2 (SPOILER&nbsp;ALERT!), Arnold  Schwarzenegger's character burns himself in order to save John Conor and all of human-kind. He wasn't thinking about himself, he was thinking about everybody else just like a true man... ermmm...cyborgggg... would.</p>
<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>No, I'm not talking about sex you perverts. I'm talking about passion as an intense emotion that drives action and motivates people. Can that emotion be related to love and/or sex?&nbsp;Sure, but that would still mean you're a pervert.</p>
<h3>Humble Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>So I guess this is kind of two values combined into one, but I think the sum of the parts is greater than the whole in this case: humility is a great quality to have, but just because you're humble does not necessarily mean you believe in yourself; every strong male figure is self-confident, but some men who are self-confident are just dicks. A man who is humbly self-confident has the best of both worlds - he knows he's bad-ass, but just lets everybody else figure that out on their own.</p>
<h3>Forthcoming Honesty</h3>
<p>Here comes another two-fer. I don't really know what to say except that there are few that things I dislike more than a liar*. (*Not applicable during a poker hand.)</p>
<h3>Adventurousness</h3>
<p>A real man takes chances. Sometimes they may be stupid chances, but most of the time, it is a calculated risk. One of the things I've always prided myself on, is that I'm willing to make mistakes. I'd rather try something and get burned by it and <em>know</em> that it was a bad idea, rather than never try it and wonder &quot;what if?&quot; for the rest of my life. If you can't learn from your mistakes, you'll never learn at all. Oh, and real men sky dive - that is adventurous.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&nbsp;think the interesting thing is that my list consists completely of qualities. There are no tangible objects on my list. When&nbsp;I came up with the list, I&nbsp;wrote down a few tangible things like &quot;friends,&quot; &quot;family,&quot; and &quot;really bitching, red sports cars&quot; but those aren't really my values. I don't like my friends because they're my friends - I chose them because the display a lot of the qualities which I value most. I chose my family members for the same reason (that's right, some people <strong>do</strong> get to choose their family members - I consider myself very lucky.)</p>

    <p>&Uuml;ber J&uuml;ne is just about over, but how did I do?</p>
<p>Well, not great, but also not terrible. I started off with a bang, but then began to dwindle as the month went on.</p>
<h3>Rejuvinatin' June</h3>
<p>I did sign up and begin training for the <a href="http://disneyworldsports.disney.go.com/dwws/en_US/events/eventDetail/detail?name=DisneylandHalfMarathonDetailPage">Disneyland half marathon</a>. However, I stopped training shortly after the third run. Nobody ever said anything about <em>continuing</em> the training!</p>
<h3>Art Guy July (FAIL!)</h3>
<p>I never ended up screenprinting anything. I&nbsp;do have materials though, and I actually bought some acetate today to make one-off stencils. So if anybody wants to cut up some terrible stencils and make some crappy screenprints sometime soon, just let me know!</p>
<h3>Alcoholic August</h3>
<p>Rob, Will and I had a few tastings (ie., got together on Sunday afternoons and got drunk) and also bought all of the ingredients to get started on a nice brown ale. However, we're still waiting for our burner to arrive so we can cook everything... As soon as that shows up, it's full steam ahead.</p>
<h3>Back to school September</h3>
<p>Check. Learned about brewing beer and a few new tips for bicycle maintenance</p>
<h3>Rocktobersaurus (technically FAIL!)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/">LSDJ</a> is still on backorder...</p>
<h3>Notebooking November</h3>
<p>Got a late start, but here are a few crappy doodles from this month:</p>
<p>So people know it's <em>my</em> notebook</p>
<p><img width="600" height="465" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0000.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Triangles and squares</p>
<p><img width="700" height="459" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0001.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Piano</p>
<p><img width="600" height="485" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0002.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Randomness</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what's going on here...although I have to admit that I do like the sleeping stick figure dude dreaming about the stick figure lady.</p>
<p><img width="600" height="532" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0003.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Musik? Music?&nbsp;Musick.</p>
<p><img width="600" height="468" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0004.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Robots!</p>
<p><img width="600" height="466" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0005.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Random Terribleness</p>
<p>Ummm...mouths/expressions andddd a terribly drawn gun?</p>
<p><img width="464" height="600" src="http://themonthlychallenge.com/sites/default/files/userfiles/IMG_0006.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dress up December</h3>
<p>Been there, done that.</p>
<h3>Classified as January (FAIL!)</h3>
<p>Nobody wanted to buy any of my crap! If you know somebody looking for a decent arcade cabinet (sorry, Arcadalicious April!) send them my way.</p>
<h3>Friendly February</h3>
<p>I was going strong with the talking to strangers. Unfortunately most of them were pretty normal people. I kind of dropped the ball on the hugging though - it was very sporadic...</p>
<h3>Monthly Challenge Makeover March</h3>
<p>I'm going to try to do some work on the site tonight, but it's nowhere near where it should be... After working on websites all day, the last thing I really want to do is work on more websites... On the positive side of things though, I did manage to set up an SVN&nbsp;instance for all of my sites and I finally have a semi-legit local development environment set up.</p>
<h3>Arcadalicious April</h3>
<p>Dominated it (kind of.)</p>
<h3>Mandex May</h3>
<p>Completed the <a href="http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/jessefulton">AIDS LifeCycle</a> - but still need the tattoo to prove it.</p>
