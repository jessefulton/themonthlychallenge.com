    <title>Friendly February? Friendly Forever!</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/friendly-february-friendly-forever</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say that this was the most fun challenge I&#039;ve done so far. It took me a while to get used to being out of my comfort zone but after a while, it became enjoyable. And I&#039;m pretty sure everyone else enjoyed it too, including the people who reluctantly accepted my hugs because they &amp;quot;had to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weekend or two ago, I went out to brunch with some friends - I think there were 8 of us. After we ate, everybody hugged goodbye. Normally, there&#039;s just a bunch of waving goodbye or handshakes, but since it was Friendly February, everybody hugged each other. Maybe I&#039;m being corny, but it was nice and I think it really did bring everybody&#039;s spirits up. Or maybe it was the champagne...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how when you&#039;re around people that are really happy, it makes you really happy too (or sometimes, incredibly pissed off)? I was that happy guy for a whole month. And to my surprise, I really enjoyed being that happy guy for a whole month. So this is one challenge that I&#039;m going to try to continue past February. Or at least until Chris tries to hug me in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hug That Could Have Been</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/hug-could-have-been</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a guy who is widely known to be a very talkative person while he is in the bathroom. In order to protect his identity, I&#039;ll call him &amp;quot;Chris.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January, Joe and I were enjoying some drinks at a local watering hole when we began discussing what the rules for Friendly February would be. Eventually we began talking about how the hugging plan could backfire - like if there were a really awkward situation in which I had to hug someone. It was at this point that our friend Chris&#039;s name came up. Chris is a very friendly and outgoing guy who feels incredibly comfortable starting a conversation with just about anyone anywhere. He is also well known to strike up conversations in the bathroom, regardless of what the other person may be in the process of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I thought January was over?</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/i-thought-january-was-over</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;What does that mean, &amp;quot;I thought January was over?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it means, is that I just got back from a craigslist date. In fact, it&#039;s the third person I met over craigslist as a result of &lt;a title=&quot;Classified as January&quot; href=&quot;http://www.themonthlychallenge.com/category/for-worse/classified-as-january/&quot;&gt;Classified as January&lt;/a&gt;. Third?!? There was a craigslist date you didn&#039;t blog about, Jesse?!? Yes kids, there was, and I&#039;m sorry if I just blew your mind. But the second craigslist date occurred in February, and I&#039;m not a total weirdo, so I didn&#039;t write about it. Yeah, yeah... I&#039;ve met three people over the internet in less than a month. Strange? Sure. Creepy? Slightly, yes. But it&#039;s all in good fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Piss Pals</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/piss-pals</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s Friday night and I&#039;m at Gordon Biersch with a few coworkers, enjoying some end-of-the-work-week beers. After a couple of drinks, I need to use the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You&#039;re a lucky lady</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/youre-lucky-lady</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;At an Irish pub on a Wednesday night, most of the crowd is participating in a team-based trivia game. An announcer asks questions and teams must write their answers on sheets of paper before turning them in for scoring. While the trivia-master grades each team&#039;s responses, there is a long, uneventful period filled with musical selections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Boulevard: Griffith Park at Los Feliz</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02/boulevard-griffith-park-los-feliz</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I was riding my motorcycle home tonight and when I came to the stop light at Griffith Park Boulevard, I heard a voice yelling at me. I looked to my right and a guy was staring at me from his car with his window rolled down. Then again - the voice came.&lt;/p&gt;
