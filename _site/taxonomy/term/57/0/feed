 <title>Core Values</title>
 <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07/core-values</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href=&quot;http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/31/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/&quot;&gt;day one&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07&quot;&gt;31 Days to Becoming a Better Man&lt;/a&gt;. And by &amp;quot;my 31 days,&amp;quot; I mean &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://artofmanliness.com&quot;&gt;TAoM&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s 30 days + 1 Jesse bonus day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your task for Day 1 of our 30 Days to a Better Man Project is to discover, clearly define, and write down your core values.&lt;/strong&gt; Before we begin, let&amp;rsquo;s be clear that we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to define goals here. Goals are specific actions, like &amp;ldquo;becoming financially independent by age 30&amp;Prime; or &amp;ldquo;asking my girlfriend to marry me this June.&amp;rdquo; What we are looking for are values: the ideas that you esteem to be of great worth and that give structure to your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve been thinking about these for a while (well, the better part of a day) and here&#039;s what I&#039;ve come up with. It was really tough cutting it down to five core values, but I&#039;m happy with the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Selflessness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true man is completely selfless. At the end of Terminator 2 (SPOILER&amp;nbsp;ALERT!), Arnold  Schwarzenegger&#039;s character burns himself in order to save John Conor and all of human-kind. He wasn&#039;t thinking about himself, he was thinking about everybody else just like a true man... ermmm...cyborgggg... would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I&#039;m not talking about sex you perverts. I&#039;m talking about passion as an intense emotion that drives action and motivates people. Can that emotion be related to love and/or sex?&amp;nbsp;Sure, but that would still mean you&#039;re a pervert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Humble Self-Confidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess this is kind of two values combined into one, but I think the sum of the parts is greater than the whole in this case: humility is a great quality to have, but just because you&#039;re humble does not necessarily mean you believe in yourself; every strong male figure is self-confident, but some men who are self-confident are just dicks. A man who is humbly self-confident has the best of both worlds - he knows he&#039;s bad-ass, but just lets everybody else figure that out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forthcoming Honesty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes another two-fer. I don&#039;t really know what to say except that there are few that things I dislike more than a liar*. (*Not applicable during a poker hand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adventurousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real man takes chances. Sometimes they may be stupid chances, but most of the time, it is a calculated risk. One of the things I&#039;ve always prided myself on, is that I&#039;m willing to make mistakes. I&#039;d rather try something and get burned by it and &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that it was a bad idea, rather than never try it and wonder &amp;quot;what if?&amp;quot; for the rest of my life. If you can&#039;t learn from your mistakes, you&#039;ll never learn at all. Oh, and real men sky dive - that is adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;think the interesting thing is that my list consists completely of qualities. There are no tangible objects on my list. When&amp;nbsp;I came up with the list, I&amp;nbsp;wrote down a few tangible things like &amp;quot;friends,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;family,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;really bitching, red sports cars&amp;quot; but those aren&#039;t really my values. I don&#039;t like my friends because they&#039;re my friends - I chose them because the display a lot of the qualities which I value most. I chose my family members for the same reason (that&#039;s right, some people &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; get to choose their family members - I consider myself very lucky.)&lt;/p&gt;
