 <title>&quot;All In&quot; August</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;think I&#039;m a little overdue for a &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve always loved poker and I consider myself to be a decent poker player. I&#039;m not great, but I believe I&#039;m better than most of the people I play against - lots of (bad) people play low-stakes poker. My problem is that I will get on a hot streak and do really well, then get overconfident and lose most of that money I&amp;nbsp;just made. I&#039;m also not a very good tournament player (at least I don&#039;t think so.) And when I&#039;m playing live, it takes me a while to calm down. I&#039;m usually pretty nervous when I first take my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the goal for this month is to get better at those things. I will be doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play at least 2 tournaments each week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play at least one live game a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End the month with a 50% larger bankroll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s as simple as that. Now I&amp;nbsp;have an excuse to go blow all of my money at the casinos. And who knows, if everything goes well, maybe I&#039;ll have found myself a new career.&lt;/p&gt;
