    <title>Good fight, Good night</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/all-august/2009/09/good-fight-good-night</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;After a month of playing poker, I didn&#039;t quite increase my bankroll by 50%. In fact, my bankroll shrunk. Not by 50%, but by enough that I&amp;nbsp;think I&#039;ll be taking a break from gambling for a while :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#039;s not my only announcement. I&#039;ll also be taking a break from the monthly challenge for a while. It&#039;s been over a year of some fun (and some not-so-fun) challenges, but at the moment, I need to focus my energies elsewhere. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll start this up again at some point, but until then, I&#039;m signing off. (Although, there is a small chance that I may try to upgrade and redesign the site just in case anybody else is still around :-p.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three Weeks in &amp; I Ain&#039;t Totally Broke</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/all-august/2009/08/three-weeks-i-aint-totally-broke</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&#039;s been about three weeks. I&#039;ve only played a total of two tournaments - I cashed in one and busted out very early in the other. I&#039;ve only played one live game. I&#039;ve played a lot of online poker. And I&#039;m below what I started with. Things aren&#039;t going great, but I&#039;m heading to the casino tonight and I&#039;m confident they&#039;ll get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; been doing pretty well (not on track to hit the +50% bankroll mark, but still pretty well) up until a the past few nights where I&#039;ve just gotten wrecked at some of the online tables. I&amp;nbsp;read an article a while ago that said if you&#039;re playing multiple tables online, your bankroll should be at least 25 buy-ins, and now I can see why. It&#039;s not common to get unlucky 3, 4, or even 5 times in a row, but it &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; happen. And if you&#039;re bringing too much of your bankroll to the table, you&#039;ll go go broke when that bad luck streak comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#039;s hope I&amp;nbsp;can head down the the Bike tonight and get back on the plus side.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Week in &amp; I Ain&#039;t Broke</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/all-august/2009/08/one-week-i-aint-broke</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been one week since this challenge officially began, and I&#039;m doing OK. Last week I&amp;nbsp;played one tournament (and placed &lt;a href=&quot;/challenges/all-august/2009/08/7-out-252&quot;&gt;7 out of 252&lt;/a&gt;) and played in one live game at the Bicycle Casino. I forgot how terribly people play at LA casinos = it&#039;s insane. If you play online poker and think people make stupid moves there, just try going to the Bicycle or Commerce. I&#039;ve played a few times in Vegas and the quality of players hasn&#039;t been great (probably about the same as online), but almost half of the players I&#039;ve seen in LA will literally win $100+ on hand, then lose it all back the next. Over and over and over again. The number of terrible suckouts I see (and sometimes lose to) is absurdly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I missed one tournament last week, but I&#039;m up overall. I&#039;m not even close to being on pace to grow my bankroll by 50% by the end of the month. Plust, this weekend I&#039;m going to Boston so&amp;nbsp;I&#039;ll probably lag behind a little bit more - but I&#039;ll &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to play a few tournaments (and maybe even head down to the casino or find a home game) during the week before I head out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>7 out of 252</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/all-august/2009/08/7-out-252</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Remember when I said that I wasn&#039;t good at tournaments? I had forgotten that I won the last tournament I played (in January) and turned $40 into over $400. And today, instead of going to the gym I decided to play a tournament online. I was en route to turn $10 into over $600. But, I managed to blow a huge lead at the final table and finished in 7th place out of 252 players. But I still turned $10 into about $80, which is better than turning it into $0.&lt;/p&gt;
