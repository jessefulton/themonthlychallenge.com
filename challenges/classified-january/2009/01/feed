    <title>Back to the Real World</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/classified-january/2009/01/back-real-world</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;January is over. I managed to sell 4 things, go on 1 date, and also go to 1 event where I didn&#039;t know anybody. That event was last night. It was a poker tournament with a bunch of people I&#039;ve never met before. Oh, and I ended up taking all their money which was kind of awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hi, My Name is Craigslist Jesse</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/classified-january/2009/01/hi-my-name-craigslist-jesse</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got back from my craigslist date, and it was a pretty decent time. We met up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ginsushi.com/&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ginsushi.com/&quot;&gt;Gin Sushi&lt;/a&gt; in Pasadena after work (which by the way, I wouldn&#039;t really recommend.) Even though I got lost on the way there, I still managed to make it there before my date and was waiting in the restaurant for a little while before she got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the second set of patrons to come through the door failed to be my date, I began getting really nervous. What if I don&#039;t recognize her? Do I shake her hand when she comes in or do we hug? But I&#039;m a terrible hugger! What if she stands me up? What if I get stood up by a craigslist date! I&#039;m a loser! Fortunately, she showed up before I had a nervous breakdown and was surprisingly laid back and cool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T Minus...Five!?!</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/classified-january/2009/01/t-minusfive</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;There are only five days left in January and I still have a lot to do. In the past week, I did manage to sell a wireless keyboard - 2 items down, 2 to go! But nobody really cares about the shit I&#039;m giving away or selling, unless it turns out to be something really weird...like free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/panties.asp&quot; href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/panties.asp&quot; title=&quot;Used Japanese Schoolgirl Panties&quot;&gt;used panties&lt;/a&gt; - because why would I have those? Exactly. You&#039;d read all about that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Hit With the Ladies</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/classified-january/2009/01/hit-ladies</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m becoming a bit more aware that this blog gets syndicated out to my facebook profile where my friends and my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; can read it. I&#039;m not sure if they do, but just in case you were wondering what the hell this &amp;quot;note&amp;quot; is about, I&#039;ll give you a quick crash course on &lt;a title=&quot;The Monthly Challenge&quot; href=&quot;http://www.themonthlychallenge.com/&quot;&gt;themonthlychallenge.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WANTED: People to Take Free Stuff</title>
    <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/classified-january/2009/01/wanted-people-take-free-stuff</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s almost the halfway point of January and I haven&#039;t had much luck on craigslist. I still haven&#039;t sold anything, I haven&#039;t had any luck with the internet ladies, and I definitely haven&#039;t gotten a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/all/&quot; href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/all/&quot; title=&quot;Best of craigslist&quot;&gt;best of craigslist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; post yet. The only thing I have done was give away and old computer I had laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
