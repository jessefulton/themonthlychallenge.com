  <div id="mission" class="og-mission"><p>Last month, the blog <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/">The Art of Manliness</a> posted a 30-part series on <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/29/announcing-the-30-days-to-a-better-man-project/">how to become a better man</a>. Unfortunately, I was busy completing <a href="../../uber-june/2009/06.html">&Uuml;ber J&uuml;ne</a> and was unable to follow their guide, so as of July 1st, I'm still the same (awesome) man which I&nbsp;was on June 1st.</p>
<p>Up until this point, July's challenge was  up in the air. But now I&nbsp;know what I&nbsp;need to do. This month, I will be striving to reach that upper echelon of masculinity and attempt to become the &quot;Guy's Guy&quot; (&quot;Man's Man&quot; is a too overtly masculine for my tastes - if only &quot;dude&quot; rhymed with the name of a month...) Normally, I'd display my manliness through my daily routine of fighting mountain lions, saving babies, and growing awesome beards, but this month I will follow the advice from an internet blog and will attempt to accomplish <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/30/30-days-to-a-better-man-wrap-up/">all 30 items on their list</a>. As a bonus, July has 31 days, which means I will get to create my own suprise challenge for the last day of the month (which may or may not involve wrestling a mountain lion.)</p>
<p>So here's the list:</p>

<p>I&nbsp;will try to follow the rules set on TAoM and do the specified item for each day. If I miss a day, you should peer pressure me and make me feel like less of a man so that I am shamed into doing it. Yeah, that'd be good.</p>

    <p>I took the <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/25/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-26-take-the-marine-corps-fitness-test/">Marine Corps Fitness Test</a> today. I didn't do as well as I was hoping (I&nbsp;have apparently lost all of my upper body strength), but I still managed to rank in the 1st class. Not too shabby (considering I'm an old fart in my age group), but there's still room for improvement. I ended up doing 12 pullups (60 points), <em>way</em> more than 100 crunches (100 points), and finished the 3-mile run in 21:15 (80 points) for a total score of 240.</p>

    <p>It's been a while since I've posted on here, and it's been even longer since I've accomplished something from the challenge list. I've been absolutely swamped with work and training for a half-marathon (and possibly full marathon.) But just for kicks, here's a summary of erverything I&nbsp;haven't done.</p>
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/17/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-18-find-your-n-u-t-s/" title=" Find Your N.U.T.s&quot;">Day 18: Find Your N.U.T.s</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>N.U.T.s are your <strong><em>Non-negotiable, Unalterable Terms</em></strong>. N.U.T.s are the things you&rsquo;re committed to, the things that matter more than anything else: your kids, your career, your primary relationships, yourself, your purpose, your spiritual practice, your hobbies, your integrity, your morals and your psychological well-being.</p>
<p align="left">N.U.T.s are the boundaries that define you as man, those things which, if repeatedly compromised, will gradually&mdash;but assuredly&mdash;turn you into a pissed-off, resentful man who will likely blame others&mdash;especially your wife&mdash;for your unhappiness.</p>
<p align="left">[...]</p>
<p align="left">Some men find their N.U.T.s over time, while others sit down and make a list. Either way, here are some of the questions you&rsquo;ll want to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s most important to me in life?</li>
<li>Are there activities I used to do for fun that I no longer do? Is someone interfering and am I resentful because of it?</li>
<li>Are there valuable friendships with men I&rsquo;ve let slip away?</li>
<li>Where am I currently having problems (unhappy, frustrated, sad, angry, resentful) in my life, and did compromising myself&mdash;and what&rsquo;s important to me&mdash;contribute to my feelings and/or the situation?</li>
<li>What dreams have I abandoned?</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m going to be      the man I want to be, what will I have to do differently?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit more complicated than it sounds...I have some ideas, but it's going to take a while to get a solid list.</p>
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/18/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-19-schedule-a-physical-exam/" title=" Schedule a Physical Exam&quot;">Day 19: Schedule a Physical Exam</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The manly man is a healthy man. <strong>So today&rsquo;s task is to call your doctor and schedule an appointment for a full physical.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually cancelled two doctors' appointments earlier this month. Not because I don't think I need them, but because the doctors were kind of terrible. So not only do I need to schedule a physical, but now I need to find a new GP and schedule a physical...It's on the &quot;to do&quot; list.</p>
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/19/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-20-perform-service/" title=" Perform Service&quot;">Day 20: Perform Service</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s task: Commit to do some service. </strong>You obviously don&rsquo;t have to do the service in the next 24 hours. Your task is simply to find a project or opportunity you&rsquo;d like to volunteer for and sign up if you can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will sign up to volunteer for some service this week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s task: Write you own eulogy.</strong> Confront your mortality and really give some thought about how you want to be remembered. You don&rsquo;t have to follow the guidelines or example given here. Be as creative as you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haven't started on this one yet...</p>
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/21/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-22-improve-your-posture/" title=" Improve Your Posture&quot;">Day 22: Improve Your Posture</a></h3>
<p>I've been trying to improve my posture for the past few days now, but it's really hard to realize when you're slumping down or slouching over. I may have to find some string and try that button-to-belt trick listed at <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/21/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-22-improve-your-posture/">the bottom of the TAoM post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, you are going to pick a manual skill you&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn, and take the first steps towards mastering it [...] Obviously, you can&rsquo;t learn these skills in a single day. <strong>This task simply requires that you take a least one step towards learning a new manual skill.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 5 months of arduous training on my bicycle, I've picked up enough knowledge to be able to repair the basics while on the road. As a kid, I used to take apart and reassemble bicycles all the time, but never really knew exactly how things worked. To get a bit more of a technical understanding of how everything works (and breaks) I signed up for a free class on bicycle maintenance through my company. There are also clinics at Performance Bicycle every week or so which I may also stop by.</p>
<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/23/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-24-play/" title=" Play!&quot;">Day 24: Play!</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Manning up doesn&rsquo;t mean turning into a robotic stiff. You should also maintain some of your boyish spirit. You need to make room in your life for things that you don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to do, but that you simply do because it gives you pleasure. <strong>So today you have to spend at least 30 minutes in pure play.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dodgeball!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to pay off our debt overnight, but we can at least get started. Today&rsquo;s task is to sit down and establish a debt reduction plan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Got no debt?&nbsp;Don't need no plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take an hour after work today and do the Marine Corps Fitness Test. No matter what kind of shape you&rsquo;re in, it will help you know how fit you are, give you a benchmark to base future progression and regression on, and grant you either some motivation to improve or a sense of satisfaction that you&rsquo;re ready for action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, I&nbsp;was convinced that it would be a good idea to wake up Sunday morning and run 8 miles at 6 AM. Thankfully, the run got delayed until about 7AM, but I was still a bit tired. So, the Marine Corps Fitness will be done tomorrow. I'm fairly confident that I'll be able to score in the high 200s.</p>

<p>I'm terrified of birds. Anybody have a pet parrot? If I&nbsp;can let a bird sit on my shoulder, I'd consider that a very large step.</p>

    <p>Why haven't I done anything &quot;manly&quot; for the past few days? I've been busy at work, I was too hung over, I&nbsp;was tired, my dog ate my computer... These are all decent excuses, but they're not good reasons. I've been slacking the &quot;become a better man&quot; challenge.</p>

<p>Person number 1 was a cyclist who was riding right behind me on my way into work this morning. First I almost spit on him, then he popped his tire so I turned around and tried to help him out. Nothing terribly exciting, but he was a stranger and we talked.</p>
<p>Person number 2 was the facilities guy at work. When I got ready to ride into work this morning, I thought I was being cool by only bringing my house key instead of my whole keychain. I&nbsp;had forgotten that I&nbsp;had a locked drawer at work which I needed to get into, and the key for that drawer was on the keychain back in my apartment. People made fun of me. Then  I&nbsp;had to talk to the facilities guy to help me try to break into the locked drawer. He did not make fun of me. Thanks, facilities guy.</p>
<p>Person number 3 was any number of people at the bars JBlake dragged me out to later that night. Believe it or not, nobody terribly interesting goes to Hollywood bars.</p>

But if the internet says they're manly things, then I guess I have to do them. I'm still in the middle of doing both and I've realized that: 1. I have too much junk laying around, and 2. I spend <em><strong>way</strong></em> too much money dining out.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>

    <p>I haven't posted on here on a while because I've been slacking a little bit on this month's challenge...</p>

<p>Last Friday, I enjoyed a half-day at work and took my lady on a date in the afternoon. We had planned to go picnicking in Griffith Park and then head over to the Autry Center after. But we ended up just relaxing in Griffith Park the whole time, drinking some wine and watching the Merry-Go-Round. It was a great way to spend the afternoon.</p>

<p>I have a terrible memory and really should do this. But I haven't yet. I also procrastinate too much.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I joined a site called <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/jesswa">43&nbsp;Things</a>. I've updated my list on there and on their sister site, <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/jesswa">43 Places</a>. It may not be the ultimate list, but it's a good start to the Bucket list. I'm sure there are tons of things I just haven't thought of...</p>
<p>Also, the second part of today's challenge was to get started on one of your bucket list items. Well, I've always wanted to <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/36364/hit-all-the-buttons-in-a-crowded-elevator">push all of the buttons in a crowded elevato</a>r. So, the next time I'm in a crowded elevator, it's go time.</p>

<p>I will do this before the end of the weekend.</p>

<p>Last year, after taking a typography course, I totally redid <a href="http://jessefulton.com/media/resume-September2008.pdf">my resume.</a> I was really pleased with the way it turned out and had no need to redo it (although the colors do need to be tweaked for printing.)

<p>I&nbsp;looked up one of my best friends from high school/junior high and &quot;sent him a facebook.&quot; It's weird how close we used to be, and then out of nowhere just stopped talking. I&nbsp;don't think I've spoken to him in at least 8 years. It's really crazy...</p>

<p>I guess a blog is kind of like a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243655/">gournal</a>. But today's task sounds kind of like <a href="../../notebooking-november/2008/11.html">Notebooking November</a>. I guess I'm going to have to start that up again. Scans to follow...</p>

<blockquote>
<div>
Here&rsquo;s your 30 Days to a Better Man-Day 3 task in a nutshell:
<ul>
<li>Pick an area in your where you think a mentor can help you and draw up a list of three potential mentors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Describe why you think they&rsquo;d be good.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By the end of the 24 hours, contact this mentor. Send an email or letter, call them, or drop by their office. You don&rsquo;t actually have to visit with them during this day, but make contact with them in some form.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a mentor when you're at Disneyland all day. I went camping immediately after and the same thing applies... I did come up with a few names though, and I'll try to ask one of them before the month is over.</p>

<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/03/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-4-increase-your-testosterone/">Day 4: Increase Your Testosterone</a></h3>
<p>The challenge for day 4 was to do at least three things which increase the amount of testosterone your body produces. The easy part was that I almost always do at least three of those things every day, but today I made sure to do more. Seven out of nine ain't bad:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get at least 8 hours of sleep tonight.</li>
<li>Do not smoke at all today.</li>
<li>Do no eat anything with soy in it.</li>
<li>Meditate for at least 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Do resistance training.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of good fat.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of animal protein.</li>
<li>Eat a serving of cruciferous vegetables.</li>
<li>Have morning sex (if you partner is willing, of course).</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/04/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-5-cultivate-your-gratitude/">Day 5: Cultivate Your Gratitude</a></h3>
<p>Day five's task is a two-parter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
Part 1: Cultivate Your Personal Gratitude
<p>It's time to take stock of all the good things in life that we have to be thankful for. <strong>So task #1 is to make a list of 10 things that you're grateful for.</strong></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Show Your Gratitude to Others</strong></p>
<p><em>[...]</em></p>
<p><strong>So task #2 is to give 3 thank you&rsquo;s to 3 different people today.</strong> These have to be specific thank yous. I&rsquo;m not talking about the waiter bringing your soup and you saying, &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; in return, although you could at the end of the meal say, &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for the extraordinary service you gave tonight.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay to thank people just for doing their job well. Yeah, they&rsquo;re just doing their job, but I think we all know plenty of people who can&rsquo;t even rise to that level, and I&rsquo;m personally grateful when people have enough integrity to do so.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So here is my list (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>My health, or what I have left of it.</li>
<li>Living in a first-world country with easy access to food, shelter, and running, potable water. However, I have heard that this Obama character is a socialist...</li>
<li>Having an unconditionally loving family. I could probably murder someone, and they'd still love me. I'm not saying I would, but that's just how awesome they are.</li>
<li>The sounds and smells of being in the middle of nowhere.</li>
<li>Being able to walk to pretty much anything I'd need. Especially considering I live in LA.</li>
<li>Electricity - <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6eff3fba0d/drunk-history-vol-2-featuring-jack-black-from-drunk-history-jack-black-derekwaters-and-jeremykonner">thanks, Ben Franklin</a>.</li>
<li>The internet. Just like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">printing press</a> before it, the widespread adoption of the internet combined with distributed computing, natural language processing, etc. is going to create an information revolution (assuming that the revolution hasn't already begun.)&nbsp;That, and I'm just a big nerd...</li>
<li>The internal combustion engine. Without it, travel of all distances would be so much more time-consuming.</li>
<li>Michael Bloomberg. Sounds like a really random thing to be grateful for, until you find out that he pretty much paid for my whole college education. I always say I hated college, and I&nbsp;did, but I'm still grateful for the chance to learn as much as I did, despite being miserable for the majority of it.</li>
<li>Not working, AKA vacation and/or weekends. Don't get me wrong, I like my job (most of the time), but after spending a long week in the office, there is nothing better than spending a long weekend relaxing. A few months ago, I had <a href="../../mandex-may/2009/05/i-wanna-stay-bed-all-day-its-mandex-may.html">one of the most relaxing days</a> I'd had in a very long time and it was incredible. I love the lazy days where the only thing to do is enjoy the present.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second part of the challenge, I'm in the middle of writing letters to three people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill - my Mom's boyfriend of God knows how many years and probably one of the most generous and sefless people I've ever met. (If you're reading this and you know him, please don't tell him.)</li>
<li>Coach Powers - My high school track coach. Few people have ever made me work as hard as him and without his help (and the help of my track team) I never would have imagined how far I could push myself, and how much pleasure can come as a result of so much pain.</li>
<li>Dr. Kraft - A professor I had in college who really changed the way I view people. I thought I was open-minded before I met him, but I really had no idea what that meant. I still have a lot of room to grow, but I'd credit him for really challenging my perspective and allowing me to become a more accepting person.</li>
</ul>

    <p>For day two, I'm supposed to <a title=" Shine Your Shoes&quot;" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/06/01/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-2-shine-your-shoes/">shine my shoes</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So your task today is to shine your shoes. Get out every pair of dress shoes that you own and get them all into ship shape condition. You never know when you&rsquo;re going to need to don a pair, and the last thing you want to do is be ready to run at the door to an important meeting and realize that your shoes are in no condition to meet the public. Having a closet full of shined shoes ensures that you are ready for any occasion, at the drop of a hat. Plus, shining your shoes is the kind of quiet, repetitive activity that will calm your mind and soothe your stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belive it or not, I don't own any shoe polish. I&nbsp;was going to pick some up after work today, but I realized that the only pair of leather dress shoes that I&nbsp;own (and occasionally wear) is a weird deep brown color. Now I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;did shine my shoes once or twice as a kid (they were probably Air Jordan's) and as I recall, the shoe polish needs to match the shoe. Well, I didn't have the shoes with me, so I never bought any polish. So, before I head out for the night, I've given all of my shoes a nice once over with a wet rag, and I must say that it did get rid of <em>most</em> of the dust.</p>

    <p>Today is <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/31/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/">day one</a> of my <a href="http://www.themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07">31 Days to Becoming a Better Man</a>. And by &quot;my 31 days,&quot; I mean &quot;<a href="http://artofmanliness.com">TAoM</a>'s 30 days + 1 Jesse bonus day.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your task for Day 1 of our 30 Days to a Better Man Project is to discover, clearly define, and write down your core values.</strong> Before we begin, let&rsquo;s be clear that we&rsquo;re not trying to define goals here. Goals are specific actions, like &ldquo;becoming financially independent by age 30&Prime; or &ldquo;asking my girlfriend to marry me this June.&rdquo; What we are looking for are values: the ideas that you esteem to be of great worth and that give structure to your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I've been thinking about these for a while (well, the better part of a day) and here's what I've come up with. It was really tough cutting it down to five core values, but I'm happy with the results:</p>
<h3>Selflessness</h3>
<p>A true man is completely selfless. At the end of Terminator 2 (SPOILER&nbsp;ALERT!), Arnold  Schwarzenegger's character burns himself in order to save John Conor and all of human-kind. He wasn't thinking about himself, he was thinking about everybody else just like a true man... ermmm...cyborgggg... would.</p>
<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>No, I'm not talking about sex you perverts. I'm talking about passion as an intense emotion that drives action and motivates people. Can that emotion be related to love and/or sex?&nbsp;Sure, but that would still mean you're a pervert.</p>
<h3>Humble Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>So I guess this is kind of two values combined into one, but I think the sum of the parts is greater than the whole in this case: humility is a great quality to have, but just because you're humble does not necessarily mean you believe in yourself; every strong male figure is self-confident, but some men who are self-confident are just dicks. A man who is humbly self-confident has the best of both worlds - he knows he's bad-ass, but just lets everybody else figure that out on their own.</p>
<h3>Forthcoming Honesty</h3>
<p>Here comes another two-fer. I don't really know what to say except that there are few that things I dislike more than a liar*. (*Not applicable during a poker hand.)</p>
<h3>Adventurousness</h3>
<p>A real man takes chances. Sometimes they may be stupid chances, but most of the time, it is a calculated risk. One of the things I've always prided myself on, is that I'm willing to make mistakes. I'd rather try something and get burned by it and <em>know</em> that it was a bad idea, rather than never try it and wonder &quot;what if?&quot; for the rest of my life. If you can't learn from your mistakes, you'll never learn at all. Oh, and real men sky dive - that is adventurous.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&nbsp;think the interesting thing is that my list consists completely of qualities. There are no tangible objects on my list. When&nbsp;I came up with the list, I&nbsp;wrote down a few tangible things like &quot;friends,&quot; &quot;family,&quot; and &quot;really bitching, red sports cars&quot; but those aren't really my values. I don't like my friends because they're my friends - I chose them because the display a lot of the qualities which I value most. I chose my family members for the same reason (that's right, some people <strong>do</strong> get to choose their family members - I consider myself very lucky.)</p>
