 <title>Talking to Strangers (again)</title>
 <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/guys-guy-july/2009/07/talking-strangers-again</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/challenges/friendly-february/2009/02&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt;, I had to talk to a stranger each day. Today, I had to talk to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person number 1 was a cyclist who was riding right behind me on my way into work this morning. First I almost spit on him, then he popped his tire so I turned around and tried to help him out. Nothing terribly exciting, but he was a stranger and we talked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person number 2 was the facilities guy at work. When I got ready to ride into work this morning, I thought I was being cool by only bringing my house key instead of my whole keychain. I&amp;nbsp;had forgotten that I&amp;nbsp;had a locked drawer at work which I needed to get into, and the key for that drawer was on the keychain back in my apartment. People made fun of me. Then  I&amp;nbsp;had to talk to the facilities guy to help me try to break into the locked drawer. He did not make fun of me. Thanks, facilities guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person number 3 was any number of people at the bars JBlake dragged me out to later that night. Believe it or not, nobody terribly interesting goes to Hollywood bars.&lt;/p&gt;
