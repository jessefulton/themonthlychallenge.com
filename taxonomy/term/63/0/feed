 <title>Target, land of a thousand and three dreams</title>
 <link>http://themonthlychallenge.com/challenges/clean-sty-july/2009/07/target-land-thousand-and-three-dreams</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;yesterday i went to Target and wound up with three amazing things to tell you. only the third one directly applies to the challenge though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1 omg, i saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Eklund&quot;&gt;Greg Eklund&lt;/a&gt;. you know, he was the drummer for Everclear?&amp;nbsp;and now is in the delightful band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoohlas.com/&quot;&gt;The Oohlas&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp;at least, i think it was him. he was hanging out in the baby aisles. adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2 The Wiz is one of the best movies ever. and by &amp;quot;best&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;i mean &amp;quot;fucking crazy.&amp;quot; don&#039;t worry, i won&#039;t think you&#039;re a &amp;quot;two-bit carnie hustler&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;if you don&#039;t like it. found it, bought it, came with eight of the songs off the soundtrack, watched it that afternoon. diana ross?&amp;nbsp;michael jackson? c&#039;mon, ease on down, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ztDwyEuiBY&quot;&gt;ease on down the road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huggablehangers.com/index.asp&quot;&gt;Huggable-motherfucking-Hangers&lt;/a&gt;. my target accomplice really wants me to have an organized closet, i think partly due to her line of work in costume. she told me i need to get these hangers because they&#039;ll revolutionize my closet space. i thought she was being dramatic. she wasn&#039;t. they hangers have changed my life and i want more. like, 100 of them. not exaggerating. 100 more hangers. these are certainly going to help with keep my closet a sane place. usually i feel like i have to choose which clothes to hang and which to fold, but it&#039;s looking like i am going to be hanging everything i own just so i can be with these hangers.&lt;/p&gt;
